# HackFSU5
HackFSU hackathon files


In this competition we worked on a device called LEAP Motion, implementing its controlles into a suit of games.
This device purpose is to enable users to "touch" the objects in games or other software.

Our group had to learn the LEAP's SDK for java, which didn't have many tutorials.

Our project was to make a software to take control of the Leap's inputs and use that to play a set of predetermined games, or make the controls mappable to however the user wants it.

Because of time constraints the project had to be cut midway.
However, we maneged to implement the controls to one game, Space Invaders.

The files here includes both the game and the files for the LEAP device controls.
